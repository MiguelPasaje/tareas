# Tareas

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

# More about this proyect

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a task manager application that allows users to register pending tasks. Users can mark tasks as completed or vice versa and also have the ability to delete tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Utilizes `localStorage` for data storage, allowing tasks to persist across sessions.

## Usage

1. Open the Task Manager App in your web browser.
2. Use the "Add Task" button to add new tasks to your list.
3. Toggle the task's status by clicking on it. Completed tasks will be marked as pending, and vice versa.
4. To remove a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.
5. Your task list is automatically saved using `localStorage`, so your tasks will be available even after you close your browser.

Enjoy using the Task Manager App to keep track of your tasks!


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
